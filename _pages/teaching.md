During the time of my PhD studies at the university of Freiburg, I have been involved in teaching in the following courses:

    2022: Teaching Assistant: Automated Machine Learning
    2021: Teaching Assistant: MOOC on Automated Machine Learning
    2021: Teaching Assistant: Automated Machine Learning
    2020: Teaching Assistant: Automated Machine Learning
    2019: Teaching Assistant: Automated Machine Learning
    2018: Teaching Assistant: Machine Learning for Automated Algorithm Design
    2017: Teaching Assistant: Machine Learning for Automated Algorithm Design

In particular, I have created the practical exercises (in python) for the students to get hands-on experience with AutoML algorithms.
The latest iteration of exercises are freely available as part of our MOOC on Automated Machine Learning.
