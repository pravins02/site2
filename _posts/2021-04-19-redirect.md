One of the many wonderful National Parks in the Unites States, Shenandoah National Park is the best to visit and indulge the beauty of nature at heart. Nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia, this national park is renowned for its scenic beauty and diverse hiking trails, or I can say it “ a hiker’s paradise” offering over 500 miles of trails that goes through a dense forest, cascading waterfalls, and breathtaking vistas. In this blog post, we’ll take you through a recent weekend hike trip to Old Rag summit trail in Shenandoah NP where a small group of graduate students came out from their every day’s hustling university life and sharing tips, highlights, and reflections from the journey from a graduate students perspective.
