I am excited to share that I recently participated in the **[European School of Magnetism 2024](https://magnetism.eu/3-esm.htm)**, ***Magnetism for energy efficient devices*** which was held from August 26 to September 06 at **[University of York, UK](https://www.york.ac.uk/)** as an online participant. This was organized by **[European Magnetism Association](https://magnetism.eu/2-magnetism.eu.htm)**.

To type bold and italic text in markdown, you can use the following syntax:

- For bold text, use double asterisks or double underscores before and after the text. For example, `**bold**` or `__bold__`.

- For italic text, use single asterisks or single underscores before and after the text. For example, `*italic*` or `_italic_`.

You can also combine both to have bold and italic text. For example, `***bold and italic***` or `___bold and italic___`.

Remember to close the bold and italic tags by using the same syntax in reverse order.
