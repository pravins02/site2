I am excited to share that I recently participated in the **[European School of Magnetism 2024](https://magnetism.eu/3-esm.htm)**, ***Magnetism for energy efficient devices*** which was held from August 26 to September 06 at **[University of York, UK](https://www.york.ac.uk/)** as an online participant. This was organized by **[European Magnetism Association](https://magnetism.eu/2-magnetism.eu.htm)**.
