I'm happy to share that I have been selected to deliver an oral presenation at **[The 70th Annual Conference on Magnetism and Magnetic Materials 2025 ](https://2025.magnetism.org/)** at **Palm Beach, FL, USA**.  This is the annual Global conference organized by **[IEEE Magnetics Society](https://ieeemagnetics.org/)** and **[AIP Publishing ](https://publishing.aip.org/)** .

I have recently gave an oral presentation at **[Graduate Research Symposium - 2026](https://sites.google.com/wm.edu/grs-program-2026/home)**, where I shared key findings and insights from my ongoing work. This is the annual Symposium organized by Graduate Center here at William and Mary.
